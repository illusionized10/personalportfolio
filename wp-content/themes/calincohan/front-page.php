								<p>I design and develop stunning websites to meet your business objectives. I won’t talk to you in technical jargon, I’ll listen to your needs, hatch the perfect plan, and create a product that gives you the best possible return on your investment.</p>

								<p>I’m primarily a web designer and front-end developer, with a fountain of knowledge in Photoshop, Illustrator, Responsive HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, WordPress & eCommerce development. But I also have experience in branding and print design (business cards, flyers, brochures, posters etc.)</p>
								<p>So if you’re a business in need of a new website, mobile app or brand refresh, or maybe you’re an agency in need of an extra pair of hands or some digital expertise – get in touch and we’ll have a chat – ideally over a coffee.</p>
								<p>Do you need help with a web or digital project? Whether you just need an extra pair of digital hands, someone to cover those dastardly holidays, or maybe you need to get a guy in who ‘knows digital’ if you don’t have one in-house – I can help.</p>
